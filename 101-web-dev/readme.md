**Update 1:** 14th September

The first session was conducted but it was not possible to make it interactive as the Teamviewer client accepted only upto *5 meeting participants in its free version*. Therefore, I might have to resort to projector presentation format for the next session. 

**Update 2:** 26th September

I planned to have a projector presentation for this week but most rooms with this functionality are located in the AEC Main Building and these rooms are alloted to the Electrical Department. As of now, the departments are busy preparing for the evaluation for NBA accreditation and therefore, it will not be possible to get the permission to use their classrooms.

**Update 3:** 1st October

As discussed in the club meeting held today, it was decided that Subhajit Saha would be hosting a session on [Ubuntu Installation](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) this week and therefore I plan to host my session the next week.

**Update 4:** 6th October

Subhajit Saha held a session on [Ubuntu Installation](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop).

**Update 5:** 10th October
